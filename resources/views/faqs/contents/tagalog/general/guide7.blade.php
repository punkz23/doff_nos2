<p>This is a great question as it's the shipper's responsibility to ensure that items, especially fragile and valuable ones, will carry out their journey damage free. Make sure that your cargoes are properly packed and wrapped to make it free from dents and scratches. Oh but don't forget to write off the important details and labels such as Shipper's and Consignee's Names, their addresses and contact details before you send your packages to our branches.</p>
