</p>

<p><b>A - </b>As we highly value your time for shipping with us, we strongly encourage you to come and visit our Manila Branch by 08:30 AM to 10:00 AM so as to avoid queing hassles during (10:00 AM - onwards) peak hours</p>
<p><b>B - </b>Book online using website <a href="https://dailyoverland.com" target="_blank">https://dailyoverland.com</a>&nbsp;or DOFF(Online Booking) Mobile App and get priority queues at the counter for fast processing of your shipments.</p>
<p><b>C - </b>Check the packaging of your shipment. It's your responsibility to make sure that the shipments are properly packed, particularly those fragile and valuable ones so that they will carry out their journey damage free.
