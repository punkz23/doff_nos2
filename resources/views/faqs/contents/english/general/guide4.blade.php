                    <li>
                        Any shipments that may deteriorate decay or spoil because of changes in temperature or other environmental conditions while in transit such as foodstuffs including meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, and cooked foods, flowers, and plants. Normally these items need refrigerants like ice and coolants to preserve their shelf life.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                            Frozen foodstuffs should be double wrapped in a watertight plastic bag and safely placed and contained in a styrobox or container free from leakage that could damage other cargoes inside the van. We recommend the use of dry ice and gel coolants instead of wet ice. -Waiver of damages
